Explore the codebase structure to understand this GOAP-based dermatology analysis orchestrator.

Key areas to investigate:

- Overall project structure and organization
- Core services in `services/` directory
- Agent definitions and their responsibilities
- Types and interfaces in `types.ts`
- Test structure and patterns
- Configuration files (AGENTS.md, package.json)

Focus on:

1. How the Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) system is implemented
2. The clinical pipeline agents and their sequencing
3. ML/AI services for image analysis and diagnosis
4. Safety and fairness validation mechanisms
5. Test coverage and quality assurance patterns

Provide a comprehensive overview of:

- Main entry points and core components
- Data flow through the clinical pipeline
- Key architectural decisions
- Testing approach and coverage
