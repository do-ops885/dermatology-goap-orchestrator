## What I do
I classify patient skin tone using the Fitzpatrick (I-VI) and Monk (1-10) scales. I use Gemini 3 Flash for classification and return a confidence score that determines downstream calibration decisions.

## When to use me
Use this when:
- An image has been verified and needs skin tone classification
- You need to determine the appropriate fairness calibration threshold
- Confidence score is needed for safety routing decisions

## Key Concepts
- **Fitzpatrick Scale**: I-VI classification (very fair to darkest)
- **Monk Scale**: 1-10 numerical skin tone representation
- **Confidence Score**: 0-1 float determining if standard or safety calibration applies
- **Threshold**: 0.65 - below this triggers safety calibration

## Source Files
- `services/vision.ts`: Vision model integration
- `types.ts`: FitzpatrickType enum

## Code Patterns
- Use Gemini 3 Flash API for classification
- Return confidence with classification result
- Route to Safety-Calibration-Agent if confidence < 0.65

## Operational Constraints
- All inference must return confidence score (0-1)
- If low confidence, MUST route through Safety-Calibration-Agent
- Store fitzpatrick_type in WorldState for downstream agents
