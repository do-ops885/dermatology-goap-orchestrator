## What I do
I ground the AI-generated diagnosis in real medical literature by searching for relevant sources. I verify that the diagnosis aligns with current clinical guidelines and research.

## When to use me
Use this when:
- Fairness validation is complete and you need web verification
- You need to cite authoritative sources for the diagnosis
- You're ensuring the diagnosis aligns with current medical knowledge

## Key Concepts
- **Google Search Tool**: Live web search for medical literature
- **Source Verification**: Confirm diagnosis with clinical guidelines
- **Web Evidence**: Citations from peer-reviewed sources
- **web_verified**: State flag after verification complete

## Source Files
- `services/router.ts`: Web verification routing
- `types.ts`: AnalysisResult with webVerification field

## Code Patterns
- Search for relevant medical literature based on detected conditions
- Verify diagnosis aligns with clinical guidelines
- Return verified flag, sources, and summary

## Operational Constraints
- Must provide at least one authoritative source
- Non-critical failure - return "skipped" rather than crash
- Flag AI reasoning vs. grounded web sources in output
