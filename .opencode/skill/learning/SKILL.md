## What I do
I update the vector store with the new case pattern for future RAG retrieval. I monitor the update for potential bias introduction and ensure diverse demographic representation in stored patterns.

## When to use me
Use this when:
- Recommendations are generated and you need to update the knowledge base
- You're storing this case for future similar case retrieval
- You need to ensure the vector store remains bias-free

## Key Concepts
- **Vector Store Update**: Add new embedding to AgentDB
- **Bias Monitoring**: Check for demographic skew in stored patterns
- **Case Pattern**: Embedding + metadata for future retrieval
- **learning_updated**: State flag after update complete

## Source Files
- `services/agentDB.ts`: Vector store operations
- `types.ts`: ReasoningPattern interface

## Code Patterns
- Generate embedding for the current case
- Store with demographic metadata and outcomes
- Validate demographic diversity in storage

## Operational Constraints
- Must maintain demographic diversity in vector store
- Monitor for bias drift over time
- Log all updates for audit trail
