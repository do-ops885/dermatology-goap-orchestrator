## What I do
I manage the development operations including CI/CD pipelines, linting, and release processes. I ensure code quality through automated checks and maintain deployment workflows.

## When to use me
Use this when:
- You need to build or deploy the application
- You're investigating build failures or lint errors
- You need to create a release or tag

## Key Concepts
- **Vite**: Build tool for production bundles
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **SonarJS**: Static analysis for code quality
- **Release Tagging**: Version management for deployments

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build            # Production bundle
npm run preview          # Preview production build
npm run lint             # Run ESLint on all files
```

## Source Files
- `package.json`: Build and lint scripts
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration
- `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration
- `.github/`: CI/CD workflows

## Code Patterns
- Manual chunks for production builds
- ESLint with SonarJS rules enabled
- Environment-specific configurations

## Operational Constraints
- Build must pass before deployment
- Lint errors are blocking (must fix, not bypass)
- Semantic versioning for release tags
